## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am currently learning C++ and Java. 

## I am interested in getting some certifications over the next summer such as Oracle Certified Java Programmer (OCJP) and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

##I am very interested in solidifying my coding knowledge espcially since this will be my second degree and I would like
to show a proficeincy in these languages to help stand out from other applicants

##I have been an HVAC/R service technician since I joined the Navy in 2012 and have been doing that in a commercial setting since
I left in the Navy in 2018. 

##I recently just obtained my commercial drone pilots license from the FAA.
